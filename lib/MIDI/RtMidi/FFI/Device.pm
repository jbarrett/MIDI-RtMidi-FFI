=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device;
    
    # Create a new device instance
    my $device = RtMidiOut->new;
    
    # Open a "virtual port" - this is a virtual MIDI device which may be
    # connected to directly from external synths and software.
    # This is unsupported on Windows.
    $device->open_virtual_port( 'foo' );
    
    # An alternative to opening a virtual port is connecting to an available
    # MIDI device on your system, such as a loopback device, or virtual or
    # hardware synth. Your device must be connected to some sort of synth to
    # make noise.
    $device->open_port_by_name( qr/wavetable|loopmidi|timidity|fluid/i );
    
    # Now that a port is open we can start to send MIDI messages, such as
    # this annoying sequence
    while ( 1 ) {
        # Send Middle C (0x3C) to channel 0, strong velocity (0x7A)
        $device->note_on( 0x00, 0x3C, 0x7A );
        
        # Send a random control change value to Channel 0, CC 1
        $device->cc( 0x00, 0x01, int rand( 128 ) );
        
        sleep 1;
        
        # Stop playing Middle C on channel 0
        $device->note_off( 0x00, 0x40 );
        
        sleep 1;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device is an OO interface for L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI> to help
you manage devices, ports and MIDI events.

See L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device::In> and L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device::Out> for
documentation on methods specific to input and output devices respectively.

=cut

use MIDI::RtMidi::FFI ':all';

our $VERSION = '0.00';

my $function_lookup = { reverse %{ $byte_lookup } };

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $device = MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device->new( %options );
    my $midiin = RtMidiIn->new( %options );
    my $midiout = RtMidiOut->new( %options );

Returns a new MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device object. RtMidiIn and RtMidiOut are
provided as shorthand to instantiate L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device::In> and
L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device::Out> respectively. Valid attributes:

=over 4

=item *

B<type> -
Device type : 'in' or 'out' (defaults to 'out')

This option is invalid if directly instantiating RtMidiIn, RtMidiOut,
L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device::In>, or L<MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device::Out>.

=item *

B<name> -
Device / Client name

=item *

B<api> -
MIDI API to use. This should be a L<RtMidiApi constant|MIDI::RtMidi::FFI/"RtMidiApi">.
By default the device should use the first compiled API available. See search
order notes in
L<Using Simultaneous Multiple APIs|https://caml.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/index.html#multi>
on the RtMidi website.

=item *

B<api_name> -
MIDI API to use by name. One of 'alsa', 'jack', 'core', 'winmm' or 'dummy'.

=head1 Some MIDI Terms

There are terms specific to MIDI which are somewhat overloaded by this
interface. I will try to disambiguate them here.

=head2 Device

A MIDI device, virtual or physical, is required to mediate MIDI messages.  That
is, you may not simply connect RtMidi to another piece of software without a
virtual or loopback device in between, e.g. via the L</open_virtual_port>
method. RtMidi may talk to connected physical devices directly, without the use
of a virtual device. The same is true of any software-defined virtual or
loopback devices external to your software, RtMidi may connect directly to
these.

"Virtual device" and "virtual port" are effectively interchangeable
terms when using RtMidi - each
MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device may represent a single input or output port,
so any virtual device instantiated has a single virtual port.

See L</Virtual Devices and Windows> for caveats and workarounds for virtual
device support on that platform.

=head2 Port

Every MIDI device has at least one port for Input and/or Output.
In hardware, connections between ports are usually 1:1. Some software
implementations allow for multiple connections to a port.

There is a special Output port usually called "MIDI Thru" or
"MIDI Through" which mirrors every message sent to a given Input port.

=head2 Channel

Each port has 16 channels, numbered 0-15, which are used to route messages
to specifically configured instruments, modules or effects.

Channel must be specified in any message related to performance, such as
"note on" or "control change".

=head2 Messages and Events

A MIDI message is a (usually) short series of bytes sent on a port, instructing
an instrument on how to behave - which notes to play, when, how loudly, with which
timbral variations & expression, and so on. They may also contain configuration
info or some other sort of instruction.

In this module "events" usually refer to incoming message bytes decoded into a
descriptive sequence of values, or a mechanism for turning these descriptive
sequences into message bytes for ouput.

=head2 General MIDI and Soundfonts

General MIDI is a specification which standardises a single set of musical
instruments, accessed via the "patch change" command. Any of 128 instruments
may be assigned to any of 16 channels, with the exception of channel 10
(0x09) which is reserved for percussion.

Soundfonts are banks of sampled instruments which may be loaded by a General
MIDI compatible softsynth. These can be quite large and complex, though they
usually tend to be small and cheesy. If you remember 90s video game
music or web pages playing .mid files, you're on the right track.

Some implementations also support DLS files, which are similar to soundfonts,
though unlike soundfonts the specification is freely available.

=head1 Virtual Devices and Windows

Windows currently (as of June 2024) lacks built-in support for on-the-fly
creation of virtual MIDI devices. While
L<Windows MIDI Services|https://microsoft.github.io/MIDI/>
will offer dynamic virtual loopback, alongside MIDI 2.0 support, it is a
work in progress.

This situation has resulted in some confusion for MIDI users on Windows,
and a number of solutions exist to work around the issue.

=head2 Loopback Devices

Virtual loopback drivers allow for the
creation of external ports which may be connected to by each participant
in the MIDI conversation.

Rather than create a virtual port, you connect your Perl code to a
virtual loopback device, and connect your DAW or synth to the other side
of the loopback device.

The best currently working virtual loopback drivers based on my research are:

L<loopMIDI|https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html> by
Tobias Erichsen

L<Sbvmidi|https://springbeats.com/sbvmidi/> by Springbeats

L<LoopBe|https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html> by nerds.de

In my own experience loopMIDI is the simplest and most flexible option,
allowing for arbitrary numbers of devices, with arbitrary names.

You should review the licensing terms of any software you choose to
incorporate into your projects to ensure it is appropriate for your use case.
Each of the above is free for personal, non-commercial use.

=head2 General MIDI

A General MIDI synth called "Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth" should be available
for direct connection on Windows. While the sounds are basic, it can act as a
useful device for testing. This should play a middle-C note on the default
piano instrument:

    use MIDI::RtMidi::FFI::Device;
    my $device = RtMidiOut->new;
    $device->open_port_by_name( qr/gs\ wavetable/i );
    $device->note_on( 0x00, 0xc3, 0x7f );
    sleep( 1 );
    $device->note_off( 0x00, 0xc3 );

=head1 General MIDI on Linux

The days of consumer sound cards containing their own wavetable banks are
behind us.  These days, General MIDI is usually supported in software.

A commonly available General MIDI soft-synth is
L<TiMidity++|https://timidity.sourceforge.net/> - a version is likely packaged
for your distro. This package may or
may not install a timidity service (it may be packaged separately as
timidity-daemon). If not, you can quickly make a timidity port available by
running:

    $ timidity -iAD

You may also need to install and configure a soundfont for TiMidity++.

Another option is FluidSynth, which should also be packaged for any given
distro. To run FluidSynth you'll need a SF2 or SF3 soundfont file. See
L<Getting started with fluidsynth|https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/GettingStarted>
and
L<Example Command Lines to start fluidsynth|https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/ExampleCommandLines>.
L<FluidR3_GM.sf2 Professional|https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/738>
is a high quality sound font with a complete set of General MIDI instruments.

A typical FluidSynth invocation on Linux might be:

    $ fluidsynth -a pulseaudio -m alsa_seq -g 1.0 your_soundfont.sf2

=head1 General MIDI on MacOS

An Audio Unit named DLSMusicDevice is available for use within GarageBand,
Logic, and other Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software on MacOS.

If you wish to use banks other than the default QuickTime set, place
them in C<~/Library/Audio/Sounds/Banks/>. You may now create a new track
within GarageBand or Logic with the DLSMusicDevice instrument, and
select your Sound Bank within the settings for this instrument.

The next step is to open a virtual port, which should autoconnect within
your DAW and be ready to send performance info to DLSMusicDevice:

    # Open virtual port with a name of your choosing
    $device->open_virtual_port('My Snazzy Port');
    # Send middle C
    $device->note_on( 0x00, 0xc3, 0x7f );
    sleep( 1 );
    $device->note_off( 0x00, 0xc3 );

The 'MUS 214: MIDI Composition' channel on YouTube has a
L<Video on setting up DLSMusicDevice in Logic|https://youtu.be/YIb-H10yzyI>.

A potential alternative option is FluidSynth. This has more limited support for
DLS banks but should load SF2/3 banks just fine. See L</General MIDI on Linux>
for links to get started using FluidSynth. A typical FluidSynth invocation on
MacOS might be:

    % fluidsynth -a coreaudio -m coremidi your_soundfont.sf2

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

The callback interface does not currently work on threaded perls. Most, if not
all, perls currently built for Windows are threaded. I have been working around
this with a non-threaded Perl built within the cygwin environment with
perlbrew.

Use of L<MIDI::Event> is a bit of a hack for convenience, exploiting the
similarity of realtime MIDI messages and MIDI song file messages. It may break
in unexpected ways if used for large SysEx messages or other "non-music"
events, though should be fine for encoding and decoding note, pitch, aftertouch
and CC messages.

Test coverage, both automated testing and hands-on testing, is limited. Some
elements of this module (especially around 14 bit CC and (N)RPN) are based on
reading, and probably often misreading, MIDI specifications, device
documentation and forum posts. Issues in the GitHub repo are more than
welcome, even if just to ask questions. You may also find me in #perl-music
on irc.perl.org - look for fuzzix.

This software has been fairly well exercised on Linux and Windows, but not
so much on MacOS / CoreMIDI. I am interested in feedback on successes
and failures on this platform.

NRPN and 14 bit CC have not been tested on real hardware, though they work
well in the "virtual" domain - for controlling software-defined instruments.
